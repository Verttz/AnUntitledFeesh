The Magma Chef (Revised)

Visuals & Personality:

    A giant, round fish in a flaming chef’s hat and stained apron, wielding a massive ladle.
    The central lava pot sits at the top center of the arena, bubbling and occasionally erupting.
    The chef is dramatic, shouting cooking puns and berating his sous-chefs Gordon Ramsay–style.

Attack Patterns:

    Boiling Soup Splash: Hurls ladlefuls of lava soup from the central pot, creating burning puddles.
    Pepper Bombs: Tosses spicy magma peppers that explode in fiery bursts.
    Pot Block: Moves to block the player from reaching the pot, using sweeping ladle attacks or creating fire walls.
    Spicy Steam: Breathes out a cloud of spicy steam, slowing and blurring the player’s vision.
    Sous-Chef Summon: Several sous-chef shrimp work at stations around the arena. If the player gets close, they attack; otherwise, they’re busy “cooking.”

Unique Mechanics:

    The player can interact with sous-chef stations—messing up a station causes the chef to rush over and yell at the sous-chef, leaving himself open for a big damage window.
    The player can toss ingredients into the central pot. If the right combo is thrown in, the pot erupts, stunning the chef and damaging nearby minions.
    Some pepper bombs can be caught and thrown back at the chef or used to disrupt sous-chef stations.

Phase 2 (Low Health):

    The chef becomes more frantic, moving between stations and the pot more quickly, and soup eruptions become more frequent.
    Sous-chefs occasionally panic and run around, creating chaos and new hazards.
    The chef tries to “plate” the player as the final dish, but if the player dodges, he slips on spilled soup, opening a final big damage window.
