Guppazuma - Boss Design Notes
1. Core Theme & Personality

Guppazuma is a flamboyant, ancient jungle fish idol—part Aztec/Mayan stone statue, part living guppy, adorned with gold, feathers, and glowing gems. Idol flair: gold-plated features, gemstone "bling," 
feathered headdress, dramatic poses, spotlights, confetti bursts, and crowd-pleasing gestures. He is egotistical, theatrical, obsessed with being worshipped and adored, and speaks in grand proclamations, 
referring to himself in the third person. Loves pageantry, rituals, and talent shows—demands the player "prove their worth" through trials.

2. Arena & Audience

    Fight takes place on a rotating stone idol platform, surrounded by jungle wildlife as the audience (birds, monkeys, frogs, etc.).
    Spotlights sweep the arena; the crowd reacts to both Guppazuma and the player (cheers, boos, fruit-throwing).
    Arena is circular, with shifting platforms or rising/lowering stone blocks.
    Idol statues and jungle plants line the edges; some can be activated or destroyed for effects.
    Totems in the background light up to showcase audience favor: When the crowd favors Guppazuma, his totems glow gold; when the player is favored, their totems glow with vibrant colors or effects.
    Crowd cheers and boos: The volume and intensity of animal cheers, applause, or boos shift based on who the audience favors, providing clear audio feedback.

3. Audience Buffs & Hazards (Bullet Hell Mechanics)

    Fruit Toss:
        The crowd throws fruit into the arena.
            If the player catches it: temporary speed boost, attack up, or a brief shield (blocks one hit/projectile).
            If Guppazuma catches it: he immediately fires a special attack (no heal or damage boost).
    Cheer Waves:
        When the crowd cheers for the player, a wave of energy sweeps from the arena edge, clearing minor enemy bullets in its path or briefly slowing Guppazuma.
        If the crowd cheers for Guppazuma, he gets a burst of speed or fires a radial bullet pattern.
    Confetti Storm:
        If the player is favored, confetti rains down, briefly highlighting safe zones (no bullets spawn in those areas for a few seconds).
        If Guppazuma is favored, confetti becomes a visual hazard, obscuring part of the screen or hiding incoming bullets.
    Rotten Fruit/Banana Peels:
        Occasionally, the crowd throws rotten fruit or banana peels.
            If the player steps on a peel, they are briefly stunned or slowed.
            If Guppazuma hits a peel, he’s stunned or his next attack is delayed.
    Wild Animal Interference:
        A monkey or bird swoops across the arena, dropping projectiles or creating a moving hazard.
        If the player is favored, the animal targets Guppazuma; if he’s favored, it targets the player.
    Boo Bombs:
        If the crowd is displeased, they throw “boo bombs” (exploding fruit) that create bullet clusters on impact.

All buffs and hazards are clearly telegraphed (shadows, icons, or sound cues) and limited in number to avoid overwhelming the player. Their frequency and power scale with audience favor.
4. Phase Structure

1. 100%-75% Normal Phase: “Idol King’s Reign”

    Guppazuma uses standard attacks (Stone Piranha Swarm, Idol Beam, arena hazards).
    Crowd is fully on his side—cheers, spotlights, and fruit buffs go to Guppazuma.
    He’s confident, showboating, and taunting the player.
    Crowd may boo or distract if the player does something stylish, hinting at a coming shift.

2. 75%-50% Mimicry Phase: “Copycat Challenger”

    Guppazuma starts using mimicry mechanics (copies player’s last move, with telegraphed flair), mixed with standard attacks.
    Crowd starts noticing the player—occasional cheers or fruit thrown to the player, but Guppazuma is still the favorite.
    Mimicry is showy but not reckless; Guppazuma tries to “outdo” the player.
    The crowd’s reaction is mixed, creating tension.

3. 50%-25% Exaggerated Mimicry Phase: “Desperate Idol”

    Mimicry becomes wild, aggressive, and sometimes sloppy—he chains moves, overcommits, and leaves himself open.
    Guppazuma is desperate for attention, sometimes “begs” the crowd or throws tantrums if ignored.
    The crowd is now rooting for the player—cheers, buffs, and fruit are mostly for the player.
    Attacks are more powerful but have longer recovery, giving the player big counter windows.
    Visual cues: Guppazuma’s color/lighting changes, crowd throws confetti for the player.

4. 25%-0% “Phase 2” (Showdown/Finale)

    Arena spins faster, hazards intensify, crowd is wild.
    Guppazuma chains multiple mimics, uses unpredictable attacks, and may trigger unpredictable attack patterns.
    Alternates between desperate attacks and moments of gloating or mockery, giving the player comeback opportunities.
    “Jungle Idol Voting” moments can swing the fight (player is stylish = Guppazuma stunned; if not, he gets a last-ditch buff).

5. Signature Mechanics

    Mimicry Mechanic:
        Guppazuma watches the player’s last attack or movement pattern, then copies it in an exaggerated, stone-golem way:
            If the player dashes, Guppazuma does a heavy, sliding dash with a shockwave.
            If the player uses a ranged attack, Guppazuma fires a volley of stone projectiles in a similar pattern.
            If the player circles him, Guppazuma spins, creating a whirlwind or sending debris outward.
        Occasionally, he “mocks” the player with a flashy pose or dance move, which can be interrupted for a stun.
    Unique Attacks & Hazards:
        Stone Piranha Swarm: Classic bullet hell pattern.
        Idol Beam: Guppazuma channels a beam attack, but only after mimicking a player action (e.g., after copying a dash, he fires a beam in that direction).
        Arena Shifts: The platform rotates or tilts at intervals, changing movement dynamics and bullet patterns.
    Jungle Idol Voting:
        The wildlife audience “votes” on who’s cooler at certain points.
        If the player is winning, Guppazuma gets desperate and uses wild, unpredictable attacks.
        If Guppazuma is winning, he pauses to gloat, giving the player a chance to catch up.


6. Audience Participation & Player Agency

    Guppazuma constantly tries to impress the jungle’s wildlife audience.
    The audience reacts to both boss and player — cheering, booing, or throwing fruit depending on who’s winning.
    The player can win over the crowd in the following ways:
        - **Stylish Dodges:** Perfectly timed dodges (i-frames, last-second movement) trigger crowd cheers and shift favor toward the player.
        - **Skillful Combos:** Chaining together attacks without taking damage, or using a variety of moves in quick succession, impresses the audience.
        - **Interrupting Guppazuma’s Mockery:** If the player interrupts Guppazuma’s dance/pose with an attack, the crowd erupts in support.
        - **Catching Audience Fruit:** Successfully catching fruit thrown by the crowd (especially if it was aimed at Guppazuma) delights the audience.
        - **Countering Mimicry:** Outsmarting Guppazuma’s mimicry (e.g., baiting him into a move and punishing the recovery) gets the crowd on the player’s side.
        - **Surviving or Escaping Hazards:** Escaping a confetti storm, dodging wild animal interference, or avoiding boo bombs at the last moment earns crowd respect.
        - **Clutch Comebacks:** If the player is low on health and makes a comeback (lands a big hit, survives a tough phase), the crowd’s support surges.

7. Victory Flair

    When defeated, Guppazuma dramatically bows to the crowd, cracks, and showers the arena with gems and confetti as the wildlife audience goes wild.
