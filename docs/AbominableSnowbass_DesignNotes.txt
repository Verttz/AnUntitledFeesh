Abominable Snowbass - Boss Design Notes
======================================

Core Theme:
- Slapstick, showboating, and pratfall humor; a washed-up celebrity fish with a flair for the dramatic.
- Arena: Frozen lake with breakable ice, snowbanks, and interactive elements.

Signature Mechanics:
--------------------
1. Avalanche Roar:
   - Snowbass lets out a mighty roar, causing both ice chunks and icicles to fall from above in telegraphed patterns.
   - Ice chunks can break ice tiles, creating water hazards.
   - Icicles create spike hazards where they land, persisting as dangerous obstacles until removed.

2. Snowboulder Toss:
   - Hurls giant snowballs that roll and shatter into smaller projectiles.
   - Sometimes snowballs contain minions (snow hares) or power-ups.

3. Stompquake:
   - Stomps the ice, sending out shockwaves that can stun players.
   - Removes existing floor hazards (such as spikes or ice chunks) from the arena, clearing the battlefield.

4. Frosty Breath:
   - Breathes a cone of icy wind that freezes players.

5. Minion Mayhem:
   - Summons snow hare minions that skate around, drop snowballs, or repair ice.

6. Pratfall Gags:
   - Occasionally slips, falls, or gets stuck in snow, giving players a chance to counterattack.
   - May play up the drama with exaggerated poses or demand applause.

7. Autograph/Showboat Moments:
   - Pauses to sign autographs, pose, or interact with the (invisible) audience.
   - Players can interrupt for bonus damage or rewards.

8. Spotlight Showdown (Phase 2):
    - The arena darkens except for spotlights.
    - If the player's fish is melee:
       - A single large spotlight follows both the player and Snowbass, forcing close-quarters combat and dodging.
       - Staying outside the spotlight causes freezing or slow debuffs.
    - If the player's fish is ranged:
       - Two smaller spotlights: one for the player, one for Snowbass.
       - The player must stay in their spotlight to avoid debuffs (freeze/slow).
       - Extra challenge: periodically, Snowbass “snuffs out” the player’s spotlight for a few seconds, forcing the player to quickly move to a new lit area or risk being frozen.
    - Snowbass hams it up in the spotlight, performing dramatic moves, and occasionally slips, giving the player a chance to counter.
    - Emphasizes slapstick and showboating.

10. Finale Spectacle:
    - Over-the-top defeat animation: slips, spins, and crashes through the ice, waving to the crowd as he sinks.

Design Goals:
-------------
- Emphasize humor, spectacle, and player agency.
- Encourage interaction with the environment (breaking/repairing ice, using snowballs, etc.).
- Telegraph attacks clearly with visual and audio cues.
- Reward players for creative play and timing (interrupting showboating, using hazards).
- Keep the fight dynamic and memorable with varied attack patterns and slapstick moments.

Notes:
------
- Consider adding supportive antagonist gags (e.g., rival fish booing, snow hare minions cheering or sabotaging).
- Use visual spectacle (spotlights, confetti, dramatic music) for key moments.
- Ensure the boss’s personality shines through in animations and dialogue.
