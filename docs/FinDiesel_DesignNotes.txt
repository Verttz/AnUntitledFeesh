Fin Diesel – Boss Design Notes
=============================

1. Core Theme & Personality
--------------------------
A massive, muscular shark in a tuxedo vest, bowtie, and sunglasses, chewing bubblegum. Acts as the bouncer outside a lively beachside club, with a velvet rope and a visible guest list. Speaks in nightclub bouncer lingo, taunts the player, and interacts with a crowd of beachgoers.

2. Arena & Audience
-------------------
The fight takes place on the sand outside the club, with velvet ropes, electric eel hazards, and a cheering/rowdy crowd. Ruffian minions burst out from the club entrance to assist Fin Diesel.

3. Signature Mechanics & Attacks
--------------------------------
- Velvet Rope Control: Fin Diesel manipulates velvet ropes to block areas, lasso the player, or create moving/electric hazards.
- Bubblegum Bomb: Spits a giant bubble that sticks to the player, requiring button mashing to escape. If not removed, it slows the player and leaves them vulnerable.
- Bouncer Bash: Swings massive fists, sending shockwaves through the sand. Shockwaves can knock over sandcastles and send beach balls bouncing as hazards.
- Guest List Gimmick: Checks his clipboard; if the player stands still, he gets confused, pausing attacks and opening a counterattack window. Minion names are crossed off as they’re defeated.
- Ruffian Roll Call: Ruffian minions burst out from the club entrance. Knocking a minion into Fin Diesel stuns him and drops coins or power-ups.
- No Splash Zone: Slams the ground, causing a wave to push the player toward hazards (velvet rope, minions, beach balls).
- Beach Crowd Interference: Beachgoers occasionally toss items into the arena—some helpful (snacks, buffs), some hazardous (sunscreen puddles, sand buckets).

4. Unique Mechanics
-------------------
- Minion names crossed off guest list as they’re defeated.
- Crowd interference can be both helpful and hazardous.

5. Phase Structure
------------------
- Phase 1: Standard attacks, minion waves, and crowd hazards active.
- Phase 2 (“Serious Mode”): Fin Diesel rips off his bowtie, attacks faster, and uses two velvet ropes at once. Arena becomes more chaotic, with increased crowd interference and faster minion spawns.

6. Victory Flair
----------------
When defeated, Fin Diesel collapses onto the sand, reaching for his velvet rope before falling unconscious, sunglasses askew, as the club door swings open behind him.
